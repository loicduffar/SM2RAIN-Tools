# SM2RAIN-Tool
Python code for reading SM2RAIN dataset (global daily precipitations between 2007 and 2019).
Extraction of time serie for N points.

Data: https://zenodo.org/record/3635932#.XoWskagzZhG

Original code by Luca Brocca, amended and completed by Lo√Øc DUffar https://github.com/loicduffar/SM2RAIN-Tools:
- Compatibilty with python 3.x
- Process several pixels instead of just one (but also works for 1 single point)
- Allow to modify the start and end years, and to copy and paste the file path
- Calculate monthly totals
- Extract daily and monthly data into a text file
- (for fun) lengthen the time axis of the graphics and improve their aesthetics using the "seaborn" library (and add an interactivity menu to them, but does not work)
- (in progress, non-functional), generate a text file containing ALL the global pixels, so that it can be opened in Qgis in a raster layer and thus easily select the pixels included in a watershed

Tutorial:
- place consecutive SM2RAIN annual files in the same folder (1 file per year from 2007 to 2019)
- rename the files if necessary when the version number varies depending on the year, which is not dealt with in the code
- copy-paste the name of the working folder in the "path" variable of the code
- enter the start and end year in the year_start and year_end variables
- enter in the lonlat_.txt file the geographic coordinates of the pixels to extract
- Launch the script and wait until the end of the processing which takes about ten seconds or more depending on the number of pixels
